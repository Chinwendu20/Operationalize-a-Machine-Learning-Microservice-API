# A summary of the project

The main point of the project is to operationalize a pretrained sklearn model designed to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests ones ability to operationalize a Python flask app. The provided file, app.pyâ€” serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls.

# Instructions on how to run the Python scripts and web app.

Run this command on your command line

```bash
python3 app.py
```
